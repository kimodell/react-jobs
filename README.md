# React Jobs :computer:

React Jobs is a multi-page application powered by React Router, with job listings and individual job detail pages. It features reusable components, clean UI structure, and efficient state management using React hooks. Users can add, update, delete and view job listings. This project helped reinforce modern React best practices, component-driven design, API interaction, and routing.
